# Breast-Cancer-Detection
For women, breast cancer is a hazardous condition. The patient will die if it doesn't detect the disease in the early stages. Throughout the world, it affects women frequently. Nearly 12% of women worldwide are affected by breast cancer, and the number is continually rising.

Goal of the project:

We have taken characteristics from both healthy and breast cancer patient cells. To differentiate between benign and malignant tumours, we must build an ML model. We use the supervised machine learning classifier technique to complete this ML project.

To build the best model, we have to train and test the dataset with multiple Machine Learning algorithms then we can find the best ML model.
Support Vector Classifier
Logistic Regression
K â€“ Nearest Neighbor Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Adaboost Classifier
XGBoost Classifier

Conclusion:

We trained all supervised classification algorithms to increase accuracy, but you can test a couple that are always in demand. After training all algorithms, we discovered that XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression classifiers provided more accuracy than the remaining methods, thus we chose XGBoost.To maintain the model's correctness over time, we always retrain the deployed model.
